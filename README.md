# The `Accessibility` LaTeX package

Authors: Babett Schalitz, Andrew (Andy) Clifton

This repository contains the `accessibility` LaTeX package.

`Accessibility` improves the structure and tagging of PDF files generated from LaTeX. These features make PDF documents machine readable and thus enable document readers (e.g. the Adobe Acrobat series) to automatically process and present the document.

## History

The package was originally created as part of a diploma thesis by Babett Schalitz in 2007. The thesis was called 'Accessibility-Erh√∂hung von LATEX-Dokumenten'. More information can be found at http://babs.gmxhome.de/da_start.htm.

Andy Clifton took on maintenance of the package in May 2019 with permission and support from Babett Schalitz, including copies of the original files from 2007. Those files can be found at https://github.com/AndyClifton/accessibility/releases/tag/v0.2-beta
