# About this Source
The `accessibility` package is contained in the `accessibility.sty` file.

## Updating the `accessibility.sty` file
The `accessibility.sty` file is generated by compiling `access.tex` using the `docstrips utility. This in turn is done by running `batch.tex` through LaTeX, e.g:

```
$> latex batch.tex
```

The results are then dependent on the version of the compiler that is used as Latex has been subject to updates over the years.
