[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/AndyClifton/accessibility.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/AndyClifton/accessibility)

The following notes are intended for anyone who has forked this repository and is looking to modify the accessibility package.

# Contents
This directory contains two subdirectories, `v1` and `v2x`.

- `v1` is the original source code for the `accessibility` package. It is provided here for reference and to conform with the licensing requirements.
- `v2x` contains the development versions of the package and associated scripts.

## Note to V2x files
These versions are based almost entirely on Babett's hard work. I have made
some changes to the source code to make the output files conform to CTAN
requirements and to make it simpler to work with GitHub. See [CHANGELOG.md](v2x/CHANGELOG.md) for details.
