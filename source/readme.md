# About this Source
The `accessibility` package is contained in the `accessibility.sty` file.

## Obtaining the `accessibility.sty` file
The `accessibility.sty` file is generated by compiling `accessibility.dtx` using the `docstrips` utility.

This is actually done by running `accessibility.ins` through LaTeX.

So:
1. Edit `accessibility.dtx`
2. Run `accessibility.ins` through LaTeX. Either:
    a. At the command line: ```$> latex accessibility.ins```
    b. Open `accessibility.ins` in your favorite LaTeX IDE and compile it as you would any normal LaTeX source document.

N.B. The results of this compilation may be dependent on the version of LaTeX that is used, as LaTeX has been subject to updates over the years.
