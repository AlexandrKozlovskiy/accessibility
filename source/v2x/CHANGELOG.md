# CHANGELOG

My changelog and working notes...

2. Nov 2019
    - Fixed problems with with umlauts in german-language documentation (approx 600 changes made by hand. Thank you, file encodings...)

13. Oct. 2019:
    - split the version 1 code from the version 2 code.
    - renamed all version 2 files to work with the .ins / .dtx paradigm
    - borrowed a CTAN make file from the LNI Project (https://github.com/gi-ev/LNI) to correctly structure the .zip file that I will submit to CTAN
    - split the samples out into their own directories, separate from the source files
