Description
===========

accessibility is intended to create tagged, structured PDF documents
from LaTeX2e documents.

Originally programmed in 2007 by Babett Schalitz as a Masters project at
TU Dresden, the maintenance of the accessibility package has been taken up
by Andrew Clifton with her agreement.

Note to version 2.0.x releases
==============================
These versions are based almost entirely on Babett's hard work. I have made
some changes to the source code to make the ouput files conform to CTAN
requirements and to make it simpler to work with GitHub.
